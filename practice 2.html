        <p>he economy of India has transitioned from a mixed planned economy to a mixed middle-income developing social market economy with notable state participation in strategic sectors.[43] It is the world's fifth-largest economy by nominal GDP and the third-largest by purchasing power parity (PPP). According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), on a per capita income basis, India ranked 142nd by GDP (nominal) and 125th by GDP (PPP).[44] From independence in 1947 until 1991, successive governments followed Soviet style planned economy and promoted protectionist economic policies, with extensive state intervention and economic regulation. This is characterised as dirigism, in the form of the License Raj.[45][46] The end of the Cold War and an acute balance of payments crisis in 1991 led to the adoption of a broad economic liberalisation in India.[47][48] Since the start of the 21st century, annual average GDP growth has been 6% to 7%.[43] Economy of the Indian subcontinent was the largest in the world for most of the recorded history up until the onset of colonialism in early 19th century.[49][50][51] India accounted for 7.2% of global economy in 2022 in PPP terms, and around 3.4% in nominal terms in 2022.[52][53] <content class="lorem"></content>

            <p>Hey I am the footer of this website.ndia's diverse economy encompasses traditional village farming, modern agriculture, handicrafts, a wide range of modern industries, and a multitude of services.[54] Slightly less than half of the workforce is in agriculture, but services are the major source of economic growth, accounting for nearly two-thirds of India's output but employing less than one-third of its labor force.[54] The long-term growth perspective of the Indian economy remains positive due to its young population and corresponding low dependency ratio, healthy savings, and investment rates, increasing globalisation in India and integration into the global economy.[55] Economic growth slowed down in 2017 due to the shocks of "demonetisation" in 2016 and the introduction of the Goods and Services Tax in 2017.[56] Nearly 70% of India's GDP is driven by domestic private consumption.[57] The country remains the world's sixth-largest consumer market.[58] Ap</p>
