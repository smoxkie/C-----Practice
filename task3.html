                <div class="content1">According to consensus in modern genetics, anatomically modern humans first
                    arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa between 73,000 and 55,000 years ago.[1] However, the
                    earliest known human remains in South Asia date to 30,000 years ago. Sedentariness, which involves
                    the transition from foraging to farming and pastoralism, began in South Asia around 7000 BCE. At the
                    site of Mehrgarh, its presence can be documented, with evidence of domestication of wheat and
                    barley, rapidly followed by that of goats, sheep, and cattle.[2] By 4500 BCE, such settled life had
                    increasingly spread, [2] and began to gradually evolve into the Indus Valley civilisation, which was
                    contemporaneous with Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia. This civilisation flourished between 2500 BCE
                    and 1900 BCE in present-day Pakistan and north-western India, and was noted for its urban planning,
                    baked brick houses, elaborate drainage, and water supply.[3]

                    Early on in the second millennium BCE, persistent drought caused the population of the Indus Valley
                    to scatter from large urban centres to villages. Around the same time, Indo-Aryan tribes moved into
                    the Punjab from Central Asia in several waves of migration. The Vedic Period (1500–500 BCE) was
                    marked by the composition of their large collections of hymns called Vedas. Their varna system,
                    which evolved into the caste system, consisted of a hierarchy of priests, warriors, free peasants,
                    and servants. The pastoral and nomadic Indo-Aryans spread from the Punjab into the Gangetic plain,
                    large swaths of which they deforested for agriculture. The composition of Vedic texts ended around
                    600 BCE, when a new, interregional culture arose. Then, small chieftaincies (janapadas) were
                    consolidated into larger states (mahajanapadas).

                    A second urbanisation took place, which came with the rise of new ascetic movements and religious
                    concepts[4] in Greater Magadha, including the rise of Jainism and Buddhism. These opposed the
                    growing influence of Brahmanism and the primacy of rituals—often presided by Brahmin priests—that
                    had come to be associated with Vedic religion.[5] In response to the success of these movements, the
                    latter was synthesised with the preexisting religious cultures of the subcontinent, giving rise to
                    Hinduism.


                    Indian cultural influence (Greater India)
                    Chandragupta Maurya with the guidance of Acharya Chanakya succeeded in overthrowing the Nanda Empire
                    and established the first great empire in ancient India, the Maurya Empire. Most of the Indian
                    subcontinent was conquered by the Maurya Empire during the 4th and 3rd centuries BCE. From the 3rd
                    century BCE</div>

                <div class="content2">It all began in 1947, when Robert (Bob) Pierce began supporting White Jade, a
                    little girl in an orphanage in China, who was abandoned by her parents. Bob gave the warden, Tena
                    Hoelkedoer, his last five dollars and agreed to send the same amount each month to help care for the
                    girl. In 1950, Bob Pierce started World Vision. The child sponsorship programme began in response to
                    the needs of hundreds of thousands of orphans of the Korean War. In 1951, World Vision started
                    operations in India and subsequently set up a single-room office in Kolkata in 1958.

                    In 1960, World Vision India started six childcare projects and worked with institutions for child
                    well-being. A decade later, in 1970, World Vision India embraced a broader community development
                    model and established an emergency relief division. The organisation also attempted to address the
                    causes of poverty by focusing on community needs such as water, sanitation, education, health,
                    leadership training and income generation. The World Vision of India Board was constituted in 1975
                    and the organisation was registered the following year under the Tamil Nadu Societies Registration
                    Act. They also mounted one of their largest relief operations in response to the tidal wave disaster
                    at Machilipatnam, Andhra Pradesh in 1977.

                    In 1990, World Vision India moved from the Community Development Projects to Area Development
                    Programmes. From early 2000s, the grassroots organisation, began strengthening their advocacy
                    efforts, particularly on issues related to child survival. They became more active in working with
                    governments, businesses and other organisations in addressing issues such as child labour, children
                    in armed conflict and the sexual exploitation of women and children.

                    World Vision India now works in 200 districts impacting around 26 lakh children and their families
                    in over 6200 communities spread across 24 states and 1 union territory to address issues affecting
                    children in partnership with governments, civil societies, donors and corporates.</div>

                <div class="content3">Each week, three of the best goals of the round (including the finals) are
                    selected as nominees. A panel of AFL selectors choose the winning goal of the round.

                    For the first time in 2006, the general public are able to vote for nominated marks via the AFL's
                    website. The results of the public voting are combined with the panel's votes. Any one of the goals
                    of the round is able to win the official Goal of the Year.

                    The overall winner is selected from the 25 weekly winners (22 rounds and the first three weeks of
                    the finals) by the AFL All Australian selection committee; the public is not given a say in the
                    final outcome. The winner receives the Phil Manassa Medal, a replica of the perpetual Toyota AFL
                    Goal of the Year Trophy, use of a Toyota Aurion for twelve months, and $10,000 for their grassroots
                    football club. The winner will be announced on Grand Final day.

                    Goal of the Year is generally awarded to a player who creates and scores a difficult goal in play;
                    it has never been, and is unlikely to ever be, awarded to a goal kicked from a set shot.
                    Historically, it has been the quality of the creation of the goal which determines the winner,
                    rather than the difficulty of the shot itself. As such, simply kicking a goal from the boundary line
                    will not guarantee a player Goal of the Year, but if they have roved the ball cleanly off a pack
                    (like Jason Akermanis in 2002) or won the ball by stealing or smothering it from an opponent (like
                    Peter Bosustow in 1981), then they will generally come into Goal of the Year calculations. Players
                    are also often rewarded for orchestrating a long run down the field which ends with a big goal on
                    the run: Daniel Kerr in 2003 and Michael McGuane in 1994 are memorable examples.</div>
